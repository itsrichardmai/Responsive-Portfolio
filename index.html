      <p class="lead">I was born and raised in Philadelphia. My parents are Taishanese and immigrated over here from China making me, as you may have guessed, Chinese. My birthday is May 21, 1999. I weigh 130-150lb depending on how I eat.</p>

      <p>I love sports. I play video games- (peaked Diamond II ADC main (farm win game) in seasons 6 of League of Legends so i'm kind of a big deal (jk)) I obsess over self-help, motivational, and inspirational speakers. (I have so many cheesy and cliche expressions about life, health, mental health, prosperity and more.</p>

      <p>I love learning and mastering new things! The excitement from finally conceptualizing and getting a boost in momentum is the greatest thing to me. Perhaps the most important thing is not what you do, where you do it, or even when you do it but rather, how and why you do it. Tasks that are too hard tempt anxiety. Tasks too easy tempt boredom. 
          The perfect balance is where we acheive Flow.
          We start our days completing the easy tasks of the day. The difficulty of the challenges are very minimal and the skill required is very minimal. With the momentum generated from completing the easy tasks, the mind feels a lot more confident to take on harder problems.
